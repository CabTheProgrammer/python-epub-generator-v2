## What does it do?

This script is meant to download and compile the books that make up *A Practical Guide to Evil* into an epub.

### How does it work?

The script will first parse the table of contents located [here](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/).
Then it will sequentially download each book and compile it into its own .epub file with table of contents and cover.

Lets hope this works!
